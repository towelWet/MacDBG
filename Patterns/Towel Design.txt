Spacing:

Use a Grid System

Follow a consistent grid (typically based on 4pt or 8pt increments).

Align elements to the grid to create order and predictability.

Embrace White Space

Add generous spacing around blocks of content to improve readability.

Give breathing room to individual UI elements (buttons, icons, images).

Maintain Consistency

Use a design system or spacing scale (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40pt).

Reuse consistent spacing patterns for margins and paddings.

Pair Spacing with Content Hierarchy

Increase spacing between sections to indicate separation.

Reduce spacing within tightly related elements.

Center Carefully

Vertically and horizontally align content within components (e.g. icons inside buttons).

Use Relative Units in Typography

Use em, rem, % for scalable designs, especially in web.
