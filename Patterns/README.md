# Patterns - Development Utilities & Reference Collection

A curated collection of development patterns, utilities, and reference materials designed for use with LLMs and AI coding assistants.

## 📁 Structure Overview

### 📄 Reference Documents

- **`Git2Github.txt`** - Git workflow patterns and GitHub setup procedures
- **`Towel Design.txt`** - UI/UX design system with Apple guidelines, typography, and design tools
- **`changes2implement.txt`** - Technical implementation patterns for complex debugging scenarios

### 🔧 Build Patterns

**`build/`** - Cross-platform build automation patterns
- Extension packaging with multi-version support
- File reconstruction from consolidated listings
- Project restoration workflows

### 📋 Code Documentation Patterns

**`listfiles/`** - Automated code listing and documentation generation
- Simple file enumeration patterns
- Categorized project documentation
- Consolidated codebase summaries

### 🚀 Process Management Patterns

**`run-stop/`** - General run/stop lifecycle management
- Multi-service startup orchestration
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Process and resource cleanup

### 🔄 Utility Templates

- **`temp_.*`** - Safe script execution templates to prevent IDE freezing during development
  - Cross-platform placeholders for external script execution
  - Template patterns for running commands outside IDE environment
  - Safety wrappers for potentially blocking operations

## 🎯 AI Assistant Integration

These patterns are optimized for use with LLMs and AI coding assistants:

- **Reference Materials**: Quick access to design guidelines and technical procedures
- **Code Documentation**: Automated generation of project overviews for AI context
- **Build Automation**: Reusable patterns for packaging and deployment
- **Process Management**: Standard workflows for development environments

## 🚀 Usage Patterns

1. **Enable script execution** (Unix-like systems): `chmod +x <script-path>`
2. **Generate documentation**: Use listfiles patterns for project summaries
3. **Manage services**: Apply run-stop patterns for development workflows
4. **Reference guidelines**: Consult design and technical documentation

## 📝 Key Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility** with Unix and Windows variants
- **Modular design** for reuse across projects
- **AI-friendly documentation** for context generation
- **Error handling patterns** and safety procedures

The specs folder:
📝 requirements.md – Describes what the feature must do from the user’s point of view. It lists user stories, acceptance criteria, and any limits or exclusions.

📐 design.md – Explains how you’ll build the feature. It lays out architecture choices, data models, API shapes, algorithms, and diagrams or flow explanations.

🗒️ tasks.md – Breaks the work into actionable steps. It’s a checklist each contributor can tick off, mapped directly to the requirements and design sections.

🗂️ structure.md – Captures a snapshot of the current folder and file hierarchy so everyone sees where things live and can spot changes over time.

🔧 tech.md – Lists the languages, frameworks, libraries, versions, build tools, and any conventions or style guides the codebase follows.

🎯 product.md – States the high‑level product vision: the problem being solved, the target users, key value propositions, and any domain‑specific terminology.
