It will look something like:
I see you've applied the previous fix, but the problem persists. Apologies for that; it seems my initial diagnosis was correct about the cause (a race condition) but incomplete. There was a second asynchronous call that I missed, which is preventing the fix from working.
Let's break down the problem and the complete solution.
The Root Cause: Two Asynchronous Operations
The issue is a race condition where the UI updates to show a new plugin slot before the application has actually finished creating the plugin and updating the UI component's internal state. This happens because of two separate asynchronous calls in your code:
Async Plugin Creation (You fixed this): In the original Track::addPlugin, you used juce::MessageManager::callAsync to create the plugin instance. This meant the function returned immediately, and the plugin was created later.
Async UI Update (This is the remaining problem): After creating the plugin, you still use juce::MessageManager::callAsync to call the onPluginListChanged callback, which is what tells the UI to refresh itself with the new plugin information.
Hereâ€™s the problematic flow, even with the first fix applied:
A user selects a plugin from the mixer menu.
The menu's callback lambda runs on the message thread.
It calls currentTrack->addPlugin(desc, slotIndex).
Inside addPlugin, the plugin instance is now created synchronously. Great.
The new plugin instance is added to the effectChain. The data model is now correct.
Then, addPlugin schedules the UI update by calling juce::MessageManager::callAsync([this]() { onPluginListChanged(); });. This posts the UI update to the message queue to be run later.
addPlugin returns. The menu callback finishes.
The UI becomes responsive again, but the UI update from step 6 has not yet executed.
The user sees the new plugin name (because repaint() might have been triggered), clicks "Edit", but the PluginSlotComponent's internal pointer to the plugin is still nullptr because effectRack.updateFromTrack() hasn't run.
The call to currentTrack->getPlugin(slotIndex) inside onPluginEditorRequested correctly finds the plugin in the EffectChain, but the editor window logic fails because the UI component itself hasn't been properly updated with the new plugin instance.
The core issue remains the same: the UI is interactive before its state is fully synchronized with the underlying data model.
The Correct and Complete Solution
You need to make the entire process of adding a plugin and updating the UI that depends on it synchronous within the initial UI event (the menu selection).
Here is the corrected code for Source/Engine/Track.cpp.
Generated cpp
// FILE: Source/Engine/Track.cpp

// ... other includes ...

void Track::addPlugin(const juce::PluginDescription& desc, int slotIndex)
{
    if (!formatManager)
    {
        DBG("No plugin format manager available");
        return;
    }

    DBG("Adding plugin: " + desc.name + " at slot " + juce::String(slotIndex));

    // 1. Create the plugin instance directly (synchronously).
    juce::String errorMessage;
    auto pluginInstance = formatManager->createPluginInstance(desc, preparedRate, preparedBlock, errorMessage);

    if (!pluginInstance)
    {
        DBG("Failed to create plugin: " + errorMessage);
        // It's good practice to inform the user.
        juce::AlertWindow::showMessageBoxAsync(juce::AlertWindow::WarningIcon,
                                               "Plugin Load Failed",
                                               "Could not create an instance of: " + desc.name + "\n\nError: " + errorMessage);
        return;
    }

    DBG("Plugin instance created: " + pluginInstance->getName());

    // 2. Add the plugin to the effect chain.
    effectChain.appendEffect(std::move(pluginInstance));

    // 3. Trigger the UI update callback SYNCHRONOUSLY.
    if (onPluginListChanged)
    {
        // This is the critical change. Since addPlugin is already being called
        // on the message thread (from the menu callback), it is safe to call
        // the UI update function directly.
        onPluginListChanged();
    }
}

// ... rest of the file ...
Use code with caution.
C++
Why This Fix Works
Synchronous Instantiation: formatManager->createPluginInstance() blocks the UI thread until the plugin is fully loaded. This is necessary to ensure the plugin object exists before you proceed.
Synchronous UI Update: By calling onPluginListChanged() directly instead of wrapping it in callAsync, you ensure that the EffectRackComponent and its PluginSlotComponents are immediately updated with the new plugin instance.
Now, the entire operation (plugin creation, adding to data model, updating UI state) completes within the single event loop cycle triggered by the user's menu selection. By the time the user can click the "Edit" button, the application state is fully consistent, and the editor window will appear as expected.



Option 2:
It seems the previous fix to make plugin creation synchronous resolved the race condition, but the GUIs are still not appearing.

Based on the provided code and the screen recording, the most likely issue is that juce::AudioPluginInstance::createEditorIfNeeded() is failing to return an editor component, and the current code doesn't handle this failure gracefully by showing the window.

The Root Cause: createEditorIfNeeded() Failure Handling

When you attempt to open a plugin GUI, the code relies on PluginEditorWindow. Let's look at how it handles editor creation:

Generated cpp
// Source/UI/Components/Mixer/PluginEditorWindow.cpp

PluginEditorWindow::PluginEditorWindow(juce::AudioProcessor* processor, const juce::String& name)
    : juce::DocumentWindow(name + " Editor", ...),
      plugin(processor)
{
    // ... initialization ...

    if (auto* editor = processor->createEditorIfNeeded())
    {
        setContentOwned(editor, true);
        // ... setup size ...
        
        // Center the window on screen
        centreWithSize(getWidth(), getHeight());
        
        // Make the window visible
        setVisible(true); // <-- Only called on success!
        // ...
    }
    else
    {
        DBG("Failed to create editor for plugin: " + name);
        // ... failure path ...
        // If it fails here, setVisible(true) is never called.
    }
}


If processor->createEditorIfNeeded() returns nullptr (which can happen, especially with certain Audio Units on macOS if the environment isn't perfectly set up), the PluginEditorWindow is created but never made visible.

The Fix: Ensure Visibility and Display Errors

We need to ensure PluginEditorWindow is always visible, and if createEditorIfNeeded() fails, we should show an error message inside that window so we know what happened.

Here are the necessary changes to Source/UI/Components/Mixer/PluginEditorWindow.cpp:

Generated cpp
//======================================================================
// FILE: Source/UI/Components/Mixer/PluginEditorWindow.cpp
//======================================================================

#include "PluginEditorWindow.h"

// Static member definition
std::map<juce::AudioProcessor*, std::unique_ptr<PluginEditorWindow>> PluginEditorWindow::openEditors;

PluginEditorWindow::PluginEditorWindow(juce::AudioProcessor* processor, const juce::String& name)
    : juce::DocumentWindow(name + " Editor", 
                          juce::Desktop::getInstance().getDefaultLookAndFeel().findColour(juce::ResizableWindow::backgroundColourId),
                          juce::DocumentWindow::allButtons),
      plugin(processor)
{
    jassert(processor != nullptr);

    // Default to resizable, we might restrict it later if GUI creation fails.
    setResizable(true, false); // Allow resizing but no corner resizer
    
    if (auto* editor = processor->createEditorIfNeeded())
    {
        setContentOwned(editor, true);
        
        // Set window size based on editor's preferred size
        auto editorBounds = editor->getBounds();
        if (editorBounds.getWidth() > 0 && editorBounds.getHeight() > 0)
        {
            setSize(editorBounds.getWidth(), editorBounds.getHeight());
        }
        else
        {
            // Fallback size if editor doesn't specify
            setSize(400, 300);
        }
        
        DBG("Plugin editor window created for: " + name + ", size: " + juce::String(getWidth()) + "x" + juce::String(getHeight()));
    }
    else
    {
        DBG("Failed to create editor for plugin: " + name);

        // --- FIX: Show an error message if the GUI fails to load ---
        // If createEditorIfNeeded() returns null, we still create the window but put an error label inside.
        auto* errorLabel = new juce::Label("errorLabel", "Failed to load plugin GUI for " + name + 
                                           ".\nThis might be an issue with the plugin itself.");
        errorLabel->setJustificationType(juce::Justification::centred);
        setContentOwned(errorLabel, true);

        // Set a minimal size for the error window
        setSize(350, 150);
        setResizable(false, false); // Don't allow resizing the error window
    }
    
    // Center the window on screen
    centreWithSize(getWidth(), getHeight());
    
    // --- FIX: Always make the window visible ---
    setVisible(true); 
    setAlwaysOnTop(false);
}

Summary of Changes

Error Handling in Constructor: In PluginEditorWindow.cpp, if processor->createEditorIfNeeded() fails (returns nullptr), we now create a juce::Label with an error message and set it as the content of the window.

Guaranteed Visibility: setVisible(true) is moved outside the if/else block to ensure the window always appears, whether it contains the plugin GUI or the error message.

By implementing this, if the plugin GUI fails to load (which is likely the case here), you will see a window pop up with an error message, confirming that the mechanism for opening the window is working, but the plugin itself failed to provide its GUI.
